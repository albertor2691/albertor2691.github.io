## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs

* Lab1

    This lab was very exciting for me because it was the first lab for the class. I looked forward to it all day, and I enjoyed this lab the most because it was very funny as we made our own inputs and asked the user for answers and made them interact with the program itself. It was hard adjusting to programming at first but this lab made it seem fun.

* Lab 9 Part 2

    In this lab I enjoyed it as well   because it was fun inputting numbers and getting responses back from the program. We imputed numbers trying to guess a number which is the secret number kind of like a game. I liked the idea of the program acting like a game where you can interact with it. Like the program was giving feedback if the number you entered was correct or incorrect.

* Lab 5 Part 2

    I very much liked this lab because we were able to make a program that asked questions to the user. It also made calculations according to the user's input. This program made calculations of converting the user's input which is a number, and converting it into feet and inches. This program makes those calculations and gives you both feet and inches in the end.
